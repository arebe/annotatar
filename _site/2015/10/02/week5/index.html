  <p>Outcomes from deployement at Invisible Monument launch event in Boston.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="lead-up-to-deployment">Lead up to deployment</h4>

<p>In the past week, I had a development push to meet the development goals that were most important to be able to demonstrate annotatAR’s utility as a docmentation tool. I met those goals for the most part. I was able to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typography and color changes for better legibilty</li>
  <li>Stripping the tweet text of URLs</li>
  <li>Screen capture button to save an image of the <code>canvas</code> element</li>
  <li>Panning with accelerometer data - incomplete implementation</li>
  <li>Integrating stream and REST Twitter API data</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, I want to use accelerometer data from the device to allow the end user to pan around - to change the position of the tweets to create the illusion that they are positioned in three dimensional space. While I wasn’t able to achieve a reliable 3D effect, I started to experiment with the <code>ondevicemotion</code> JavaScript event, and <code>accellerationIncludingGravity</code> on the X and Y axes. While I was able to achieve somewhat fluid UX on my laptop, the calibration did not translate properly to my Galaxy 4G device.</p>

<h4 id="invisible-monument">Invisible Monument</h4>

<p>The Invisible Monument launch event, #LuncheonOnTheGrass took place on 30 Sept 2015, in Dewey Square, Boston. <a href="http://invisiblemonument.com/">Invisible Monument</a> is a locative sound installation created by Halsey Burgund and Lara Baladi, that cn be experienced using an iOS application. Various sond elements are triggered by geolocations around Dewey Square. </p>

<p>I met the team on site for the launch event and started taking screen captures with annotatAR. I used three different Twitter tags: #occupy, #the99, and #luncheononthegrass. I adjusted the “die-off” rate for each of the tweets according to how often the tag was used. As the tweets get older, they become smaller and more transparent. </p>

<h4 id="historic-tweets">Historic tweets</h4>

<p>I would like to be able to overlay historic tweet data as well as current tweets. However, the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search">Twitter REST API</a> allows access to tweets created within the past couple of weeks only.</p>

<p>Third-party services such as <a href="https://gnip.com/">GNIP</a> are social media brokers from which you can purchase historic data. The base rate for historic tweet data starts at $1.1k and increased depending on length of time and number of tweets returned by the query. </p>

<p>While this is cost-prohibitive for the time being, it does add a layer of utility to annotatAR. I have already implemented the ability to download the database of tweets as a CSV file, which could be quite useful in capturing an independent record of a hashtag.</p>

<p>Additionally, I spoke to one of the participants in #LuncheonOnTheGrass who directed me to an archive of tweets from the Occupy movement, available at <a href="http://occupyresearch.net/">Occupy Research</a> and <a href="http://r-shief.org/">R-Shief</a>. These might be a useful corpus to draw on in future iterations. </p>

<h4 id="future-of-invisible-monument">Future of Invisible Monument</h4>

<p>Lara and team were quite excited by the output from annotatAR, and will use my documentation of #LuncheonOnTheGrass as part of the ongoing archive for Invisible Monument / Vox Populi. </p>

<p>We began to discuss how annotatAR might be integrated with Halsey’s <a href="http://www.roundware.org/">Roundware</a> platform, to provide an integrated experience with the audioscape. Future directions for Invisible Monument are quite exciting, and I hope to continue to work with them. However, I think this will only be possible of Halsey ports Roundware to Android or the mobile web.</p>

<h4 id="near-term-goals">Near term goals</h4>

<p>More immediate goals for annotatAR include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bug fixing - hashtags on the stream seemed not to work on the website (though the stream worked on the local version)</li>
  <li>Bug fixing - houston doesn’t seem to work, maybe due to special characters?</li>
  <li>Fluid accelerometer use</li>
  <li>URL routing for hashtag display</li>
  <li>Automation or parameterization of annotatAR UX elements (ie age til die-off)</li>
  <li>Capturing additional tweet data (ie user, associated photos) for posterity</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these goals are achieved it may be time to turn to text analysis and a desktop site.</p>
