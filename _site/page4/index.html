    <p>In which our hero recounts the details of this summer’s work….</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="user-interaction-paradigm">User interaction paradigm</h4>

<p>annotatAR was inspired by a project I worked on in Fall 2014, <a href="http://docshop0.tumblr.com/">Notes from El Saniyya</a>. As part of <a href="http://docshop.space/">DocShop at metaLab</a>, I worked with Egyptian artist Lara Baladi to create a prototype of a living timeline of the Arab Spring. The <em>Notes…</em> event was highly participatory and we wondered what the next steps for engaging with a multi-media archive might be like.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You walk into a gallery space, with a curved wall with a huge timeline, each point on the timeline is an event in the Arab Spring / Tahrir Square 21 days. you want to add your own comment to the timeline, reacting to something on the timeline that triggered a memory or emotion - given any possible technology or material, how would you leave a message?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is motivation for utilizing an augmented reality platform, and Twitter as a common social interface.</p>

<h4 id="meteor">Meteor</h4>

<p>The major accomplishment achieved this summer was getting started with <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/">Meteor.js</a>. After reading docs and going through an example project tutorial, I was convinced that this was the technology on which I should build annotatAR. What first drew me to Meteor is the ability to code everything in Javascript, the active community, and the well-designed forward-looking codebase. I sat with a friend for an informational session to learn about how to utilize <a href="https://www.eventedmind.com/feed/meteor-what-is-meteor-bindenvironment">asynchronous external requests</a> in Meteor, through <a href="https://meteorhacks.com/fibers-eventloop-and-meteor">fibers</a> and <code>Meteor.bindEnvironment</code>. I’m starting to see even more value in how Meteor encourages code modularization, which may be quite helpful as the project develops.</p>

<h4 id="alpha-site">Alpha site</h4>

<p>With my newly acquired knowledge of Meteor, I built a test application called <em>truthtweets</em>, which connects to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public">Twitter Firehose API</a> and overlays tweet texts that utilize the hashtag <em>#truth</em> onto a video stream from <code>getUserMedia</code> element. Voilà!</p>

<h4 id="next-directions">Next directions</h4>

<p>In the short term, the mobile application has a number of refinements to be achieved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strike>twitter api config file - untracked (not shared on github)</strike>
    <p>done! - now using settings.json</p>
  </li>
  <li>resize navigator to fit device screen</li>
  <li>use accelerometer data to detect motion and update tweet position</li>
  <li>turn the stream on and display new tweets</li>
  <li>change alpha based on tweet createdAt</li>
  <li>deploy to meteor cloud or other web server</li>
  <li><em>what if tweets became colored to reflect the background video feed? - lexigraph</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="looking-ahead-this-month">Looking ahead this month</h4>

<p>My first <a href="/annotatar/2015/09/02/milestones">project milestone</a> will be next week, when I deploy a beta version of the application on a live server and test it at the <a href="http://yami-ichi.biz/nyc/">New York City Internet Yami-Ichi</a> event by giving the URL out to a (small) number of attendees. This early-stage test will be crucial in refining the user interactions and aesthetics. In addition to the application itself, I will design a brief Google forms survey to collect UX feedback.</p>
