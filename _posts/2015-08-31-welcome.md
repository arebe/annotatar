This blog will track my progress on my ALM capstone project, annotatAR. I've written a bunch about it already, which you can read [here](#) - link to my proposal coming soon!

### Some links to track:

### Summer work

Over the summer, I learned a bit about [meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) and began building a version 0 of the site, which connects to the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public), grabs tweets with a particular hashtag, and displays them on top of a video feed from [getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia). 

### Next steps

While the most basic form of this mechanic "works," there is much to be done in terms of styling, user interactions, and geolocation. Additionally, meta-analysis of the tweets will add layers of semantics to both the mobile site and eventually to a desktop archival version.
