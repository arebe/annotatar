In which our hero recounts the details of this summer's work....

#### User interaction

annotatAR was inspired by a project I worked on in Fall 2014, [Notes from El Saniyya](http://docshop0.tumblr.com/). As part of [DocShop at metaLab](http://docshop.space/), I worked with Egyptian artist Lara Baladi to create a prototype of a living timeline of the Arab Spring. The _Notes..._ event was highly participatory and we wondered what the next steps for engaging with a multi-media archive might be like.

> You walk into a gallery space, with a curved wall with a huge timeline, each point on the timeline is an event in the Arab Spring / Tahrir Square 21 days. you want to add your own comment to the timeline, reacting to something on the timeline that triggered a memory or emotion - given any possible technology or material, how would you leave a message?

This is moativation for utilizing an augmented reality platform, and Twitter as a common social interface.

#### Meteor

The major accomplishment achieved this summer was getting started with [Meteor.js](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/). After reading docs and going through an example project tutorial, I was convinced that this was the technology on which I should build annotatAR. What first drew me to Meteor is the ability to code everything in Javascript, the active community, and the well-designed forward-looking codebase. I sat with a friend for an informational session to learn about how to utilize [asynchronous external requests](https://www.eventedmind.com/feed/meteor-what-is-meteor-bindenvironment) in Meteor, through [fibers](https://meteorhacks.com/fibers-eventloop-and-meteor) and `Meteor.bindEnvironment`. I'm starting to see even more value in how Meteor encourages code modularization, which may be quite helpful as the project develops.

#### Alpha site

With my newly acquired knowledge of Meteor, I built a test application called _truthtweets_, which connects to the [Twitter Firehose API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public) and overlays tweet texts that utilize the hashtag _#truth_ onto a video stream from `getUserMedia` element. Voil√†!

#### Next directions

In the short term, the mobile application has a number of refinements to be achieved:

* **twitter api config file - untracked (not shared on github)**
* resize navigator to fit device screen
* use accelerometer data to detect motion and update tweet position
* turn the stream on and display new tweets
* change alpha based on tweet createdAt
* deploy to meteor cloud or other web server
* _what if tweets became colored to reflect the background video feed? - lexigraph_


#### Looking ahead this month

My first [project milestone]({{site.baseurl}}/2015/09/02/milestones) will be next week, when I deploy a beta version of the application on a live server and test it at the [New York City Internet Yami-Ichi](http://yami-ichi.biz/nyc/) event by giving the URL out to a (small) number of attendees. This early-stage test will be crucial in refining the user interactions and aesthetics. In addition to the application itself, I will design a brief Google forms survey to collect UX feedback.
