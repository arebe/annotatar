    <p>Learning about routing in Meteor.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="routing-in-meteor">Routing in Meteor</h4>

<p>This week I spent my time learning about how to implement URL routing using Meteor. Routing is a key functionality as it will will allow me to dynamically generate pages using URL parameters, and use different layouts for each type of page.</p>

<p>The site architecture will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>index</li>
  <li>ar
    <ul>
      <li>occupyboston</li>
      <li>invisiblemonuments</li>
      <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The index page is the documentation site, which will be served if someone visits the main URL, with a map and link to the blog. The AR page will house the Javascript function that detects geolocation, and re-routes to the appropriate URL.</p>

<p>There are two major routing libraries in Meteor: <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/meteorhacks/flow-router">Flow Router</a> and <a href="http://iron-meteor.github.io/iron-router/">Iron:Router</a>. I tried out both and ultimately decided to use Iron:router.</p>

<h4 id="flow-router">Flow Router</h4>

<p>This routing library is rigorously tested and was recommended by the folks at the Meteor.js meetup that I attended last month. It’s designed for client-side, non-reactive routing. The advice from the Meteor meetup was that Flow Router has a slightly steeper learning curve, but it has a design that enforces best practices - the application is unlikely to break for mysterious reasons, or work improperly. The limitation is that it must be used with another routing library for server-side routing, such as <a href="https://github.com/meteorhacks/picker">Picker</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ironrouter">Iron:Router</h4>

<p>Iron Router is the best-documented router for Meteor, and also has the largest user base. What interested me in it is the extensive set of websites for getting started with the library. I tried out Flow Router and found the examples difficult to translate to my application but had success with a <a href="https://www.codetutorial.io/meteor-routing-and-layout/">tutorial for Iron Router</a>. It also appeals to me to be able to use the same router for server-side routing, as the geolocation function will utilize a server-side route to the appropriate database of tweets. </p>

<p>I was able to get up and running with a two-page website and Iron Router, though I am still troubleshooting some issue with the AR script.</p>

<h4 id="templating-and-css">Templating and CSS</h4>

<p>I’m using the standard templating language, <a href="http://meteorcapture.com/spacebars/">Spacebars</a>, for my application, and installed the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework.</p>

<h4 id="next-directions">Next directions</h4>

<p>Once I have fixed the bugs caused by the new site architecture, I will move on to creating the geolocative function for the AR page and re-routing to a sub-page that will display a particular hashtag.</p>
