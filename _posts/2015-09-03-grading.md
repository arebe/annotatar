title: Capstone Project Grading Rubric
---

As part of this week's assignments, I have developed a grading rubric for annotatAR, for the scope of this fall's Capstone Design Studio. This rubric has six dimensions, with three criteria each. The dimensions are categorized in two sub-sections: _mobile_ and _desktop_.

| _Mobile Site (75%)_ | Excellent | Competent | Needs Work |
|---------------------|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| **Functionality** :: Users can overlay tweets on a video stream; Device compatibility;  Geolocative;  Users can take screenshot |  |  |  |
| **Aesthetics** :: Tweet metadata is visually encoded; Tweet position changes with device motion; Appealing visual design; |  |  |  |
| **Scalability** :: Deployable at a variety of events; Github repo + documentation for further development |  |  |  |


| _Desktop Site (25%)_ | Excellent | Competent | Needs Work |
|----------------|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| **Functionality** :: Users can view event-specific video with tweet overlay; Cross-browser compatibility | | | |
| **Aesthetics** :: Tweet metadata is visually encoded; Timeline of event is expressed visually | | | |
| **Scalability** :: Deployable for multiple events; Integrates with other social media feeds | | | |
