title: Capstone Project Grading Rubric
---

As part of this week's assignments, I have developed a grading rubric for annotatAR, for the scope of this fall's Capstone Design Studio. This rubric has six dimensions, with three criteria each. The dimensions are categorized in two sub-sections: _Mobile Site_ and _Desktop Site_. The grades are weighted to emphasize the _Mobile Site_.
