Outcomes from deployement at Invisible Monument launch event in Boston.

#### Lead up to deployment

In the past week, I had a development push to meet the development goals that were most important to be able to demonstrate annotatAR's utility as a docmentation tool. I met those goals for the most part. I was able to implement:

* Typography and color changes for better legibilty
* Stripping the tweet text of URLs
* Screen capture button to save an image of the `canvas` element
* Panning with accelerometer data - incomplete implementation
* Integrating stream and REST Twitter API data

Ideally, I want to use accelerometer data from the device to allow the end user to pan around - to change the position of the tweets to create the illusion that they are positioned in three dimensional space. While I wasn't able to achieve a reliable 3D effect, I started to experiment with the `ondevicemotion` JavaScript event, and `accellerationIncludingGravity` on the X and Y axes. While I was able to achieve somewhat fluid UX on my laptop, the calibration did not translate properly to my Galaxy 4G device.

#### Invisible Monument

The Invisible Monument launch event, #LuncheonOnTheGrass took place on 30 Sept 2015, in Dewey Square, Boston. [Invisible Monument](http://invisiblemonument.com/) is a locative sound installation created by Halsey Burgund and Lara Baladi, that cn be experienced using an iOS application. Various sond elements are triggered by geolocations around Dewey Square. 

I met the team on site for the launch event and started taking screen captures with annotatAR. I used three different Twitter tags: #occupy, #the99, and #luncheononthegrass. I adjusted the "die-off" rate for each of the tweets according to how often the tag was used. As the tweets get older, they become smaller and more transparent.

#### Historic tweets

I would like to be able to overlay historic tweet data as well as current tweets. However, the [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search) allows access to tweets created within the past couple of weeks only.

Third-party services such as [GNIP](https://gnip.com/) are social media brokers from which you can purchase historic data. The base rate for historic tweet data starts at $1.1k and increased depending on length of time and number of tweets returned by the query. 

While this is cost-prohibitive for the time being, it does add a layer of utility to annotatAR. I have already implemented the ability to download the database of tweets as a CSV file, which could be quite useful in capturing an independent record of a hashtag.

Additionally, I spoke to one of the participants in #LuncheonOnTheGrass who directed me to an archive of tweets from the Occupy movement, available at [Occupy Research](http://occupyresearch.net/) and [R-Shief](http://r-shief.org/). These might be a useful corpus to draw on in future iterations. 

#### Future of Invisible Monument

Lara and team were quite excited by the output from annotatAR, and will use my documentation of #LuncheonOnTheGrass as part of the ongoing archive for Invisible Monument / Vox Populi. 

We began to discuss how annotatAR might be integrated with Halsey's [Roundware](http://www.roundware.org/) platform, to provide an integrated experience with the audioscape. Future directions for Invisible Monument are quite exciting, and I hope to continue to work with them. However, I think this will only be possible of Halsey ports Roundware to Android or the mobile web.

#### Near term goals

More immediate goals for annotatAR include:

* Bug fixing - hashtags on the stream seemed not to work on the website (though the stream worked on the local version)
* Bug fixing - houston doesn't seem to work, maybe due to special characters?
* Fluid accelerometer use
* URL routing for hashtag display
* Automation or parameterization of annotatAR UX elements (ie age til die-off)
* Capturing additional tweet data (ie user, associated photos) for posterity

Once these goals are achieved it may be time to turn to text analysis and a desktop site.
