  <p>Overthinking and under-doing in October. Next steps.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="how-i-spent-october">How I spent October</h4>

<p>I’ve had a very fruitful October. Unfortunately, this activity has not been focused on my own projects and thus annotatAR has been left on the wayside for far too long.</p>

<p>While I’ve been a bit delinquent in updating both this project blog and working on the project itself, I have accomplished much rumination on the final outcome for this project. </p>

<p>I somewhat switched focus at the beginning of October, and began to think of the project as a sort of meta-documentation tool whose primary end-user would be me. This focus hasn’t sat well with me though, as the spirit of the project has been to build experientially what has already been ongoing virtually.</p>

<p>Many questions remain to be answered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who is the audience for the mobile site? </li>
  <li>In what context will they discover it?</li>
  <li>Will the site display current or historic tweets?</li>
  <li>What controls will the end user have over the tweets being display?</li>
  <li>Will the website generate a database of tweet data?</li>
  <li>Will multiple hashtags be available at a particular location?</li>
  <li>Will the end user be able to change tweets?</li>
  <li>Will there be an administrative site where an admin can set up a new database entry for a geolocation / hashtag pairing?</li>
</ul>

<p>I will attempt to clarify my thinking on these topics in this post.</p>

<h4 id="audience">Audience</h4>

<p>My current thinking on the purpose of annotatAR is to fully embrace the art project aspect. Rather than thinking that this project is a tool to make other works, I would like to present it as a work in itself, a generative social media artwork. </p>

<p>In this case, the audience / end user becomes those interested in radical use of digital spaces, Twitter and social media, and contemporary activist movements.</p>

<p>The limitations of this direction are that the primary purpose is no longer documentation of an event in process. The Twitter stream API will likely not be useful - it will be necessary to utilize historic tweet data, such as has been gathered by Occupy Research.</p>

<h4 id="context">Context</h4>

<p>The working context for annotatAR will be a digital exhibition of some kind, where the audience finds out about the work through some third party - much like the Invisible Monument project. The artwork will be available for a specified timeframe during which someone can go to the appropriate location and experience the augmented reality app on their Android mobile device. </p>

<p>This work might be highlighted in a launch event or tour of some kind. Once annotatAR has a first version, I can begin to look at fellowships and opportunities to take the project further and share it with communities.</p>

<h4 id="stream-vs-rest-vs-historic">Stream vs REST vs Historic</h4>

<p>The Twitter API has two versions: the stream which affords access to real-time data as it is posted - and the REST version that allows queries based on various parameters.</p>

<p>For the conceptual purposes of this project, the stream is ideal, as it expresses the contemporality of dual sites:  online and in the “juice” of physical space. However, the stream depends highly the volume of tweets being generated in a given timeframe; if the event is generating a low level of interest on Twitter, than annotatAR will have sparse data to work with and be less effective as a visual presentation. </p>

<p>My deployment at the Invisible Monument launch utilized a blend of REST and stream in order to overcome the limitations of the stream API. </p>

<p>As the purpose of annotatAR has solidified around an experiential artwork, it becomes imperative to use Twitter API in a way that best expresses concept of the piece. The idea of synesthesia becomes an important concept - as we walk through the juice, the ideas and social sites of Twitter are invisible but present. annotatAR interacts with the visual sense to encode the virtual component of a multi-sited co-occurring event.</p>

<p>The use of historic data, where it exists, affords a slightly different expression of this co-occurrence. Instead of expressing contemporality, the visual metaphor would be more archeological in tone - that of unearthing and re-experiencing an event in the past, like an historical marker expressed in virtuality.</p>

<h4 id="hashtag--geolocation">Hashtag / Geolocation</h4>

<p>Should multiple hashtags be associated with a specific geolocation? </p>

<p>So doing might dilute the strength of the connection between a juice space and a twitter hashtag settlement - but it would also afford a more nuanced understanding of historicity of a space.</p>

<h4 id="end-user-controls">End user controls</h4>

<p>Given the above discussion, the end user will have some minimal controls - to select a hashtag (if there are multiple available at the geolocation), to pan around, to take a screenshot, and to scroll through time.</p>

<h4 id="desktop-site">Desktop site</h4>

<p>The desktop site will be quite minimal - a brief description of the project and map of the geolocations available. A sign-up for newsletter of project updates. </p>

<h4 id="questions">Questions</h4>

<p>What historic tweet data is available? - this needs to be answered ASAP to properly scope this and future versions.</p>

<p>Future directions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Funding for a tweet aggregation service such as GNIP</li>
  <li>Development of a robust administrative layer</li>
  <li>Development of a way to share screen captures </li>
  <li>Integration with the Invisible Monument project (iOS)</li>
  <li>Development of a robust data collection system to gather data on contemporary events</li>
</ul>

<p>More immediate goals for annotatAR (still) include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bug fixing - hashtags on the stream seemed not to work on the website (though the stream worked on the local version)</li>
  <li>Fluid accelerometer use</li>
  <li>URL routing for hashtag display</li>
  <li>Automation or parameterization of annotatAR UX elements (ie age til die-off)</li>
  <li>Pulling in historic tweets from Occupy Research (or other source)</li>
  <li>Single-page desktop site</li>
</ul>
